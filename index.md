**Question 9**
- A chain of retail stores uses software to manage telephone calls from customers. The system was recently upgraded. Customers interacted with the original system using their phone keypad. Customers interact with the upgraded system using their voice. The upgraded system (but not the original system) stores all information from the calling session in a database for future reference. This includes the customerâ€™s telephone number and any information provided by the customer (name, address, order number, credit card number, etc.).The original system and the upgraded system are described in the following flowcharts. Each flowchart uses the following blocks.
- What I put: C Incorrect. Unlike in the original system, customers do not begin the call session by hearing a prerecorded message with answers to common questions.
- What is the correct answer: B Correct. The company is not able to provide a human representative for calls made after business hours.
**Question 24:**
- Which of the following best explains how data is typically assembled in packets for transmission over the Internet?
- What I put: B Each packet contains an encrypted version of the data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing the key needed to decrypt the data.
- What is the correct answer: A: Each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data.

#### Final 2: 48/50 and corrections:

**Question 1:**
- Which of the following best describes the ability of parallel computing solutions to improve efficiency?
- What I put: B Incorrect. The efficiency of a parallel solution is limited by a sequential portion. Eventually, adding parallel portions will no longer meaningfully increase efficiency.
- What is the correct answer: D Parallel computing solutions consist of a parallel portion and a sequential portion. When increasing the use of parallel computing in a solution, the efficiency of the solution is limited by the sequential portion. This means that at some point, adding parallel portions will no longer meaningfully increase efficiency.
**Question 27:**
- Which of the following best describes one of the benefits of using an iterative and incremental process of program development?
- What I put: A. This option is incorrect. Unsolvable problems cannot be solved with an algorithm.
- What is the correct answer: D: Incrementally adding code segments to correct, working programs can help programmers identify new errors that are introduced.
