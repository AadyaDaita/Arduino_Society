### 5.1-5.6 TPT Notes
**Beneficial and Harmful Effects (5.1)**

**Computing Bias (5.3)**
- Explicit Data -voluntarily giving data about yourself
- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases written into the algorithm or biases in the data used by the innovation. 
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovation (if they really deserve it) as a way of combating existing human biases.  

**Crowdsourcing (5.4)**
- Science has been affected by using distributed and “citizen science” to solve scientific problems. 
- Citizen science is the scientific research conducted in a whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists. Who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices. 
- Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing. 
- Crowdsourcing- the practice of obtaining information or input into a task or project by enlisting the services of a large number of people, either paid or unpaid, typically via the internet.
- Offer new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding. 

**Legal and Ethical Concerns (5.5)**
- Copy right protects intellectual property unless you allow it. 
- The legal way to use other people’s content is by following the license that they have on their property. 
- Creative Commons -  tells what you can or can’t do with the property. It is a license. 
- Open-source - programs that are free on the internet
- Open Access - online research output free of any and all restrictions on access and free of restrictions on access and free of restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions. 

**Safe Computing (5.6)**

_5.6.1_
- Personally Identifiable Information is information about an individual. Hackers can steal these.

_5.6.2_
- Authentication measured protect devices and information from unauthorized access. 
- Authentication measured includes strong passwords and multi-factor authentication 
- Viruses modify the operating system and allow anyone without the correct authorization to enter into your accounts. Malware damages a system and poses to be the original system itself.
- Encryption - the coded message that holds data. It prevents unauthorized malware from accessing data that they are not supposed to. 
- Symmetric - one key used to both encrypt and decrypt data. Sender and receiver both know this key
- Asymmetric - Public key encryption: uses two keys. The public key for encrypting and a private key for decrypting. 
- The sender does not need the receiver’s private key to encrypt a message. 
- The receiver’s private key IS required to decrypt the message. 
- The sender uses the receiver’s public key to encrypt the message. The receiver only had the private key, so they can only decrypt the encrypted message.
- Digital Certificate: certificate authorities issue digital certificates that validate the ownership of the encryption keys used in secure communications and are based on a trust model. 
- Decryption - decoding an encrypted message.  

_5.6.3_
- Phishing: An attempt to trick a user into providing personal information. 
- Keyloggers: records every keystroke made by a user in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords or other confidential information. 
- Rogue Access Point: A wireless network that can give unauthorized access to secure networks. When data is being sent in a network, the hacker could steal in on the way there, before it reaches the secure location.
