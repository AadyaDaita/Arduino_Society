### Week 2
In week 2, we explored classes. We built a class with factorials, and printing the factorial of any number given. For an additional math function, I chose the factors of any number given. I did this using classes, and I added a tester. Lastly, the palidrome function was extra credit, and I wasn't able to figure it out. 

### Week 1
In week 1, we learned about loops and lists. For this, we had a list named Favorite_subjects among a dictionary, which was among a list. We printed Favorite_subjects list 3 different ways: with a for loop, while loop, and recursive loops. Additionally, we did printing the nth term of the fibonacci sequence. In addition to this, I printed all the number of the fibonacci seuence before the nth term. 

### Week 0
In week 0, we set up the menu and submenus, as well as customizing it. We impirted our swap and matrix from last trimester. Additionally, we also we also did patterns of printing a christmas tree, and the ship animation. The biggest challenge this week was making the efficient ship run.
