### 5.1-5.6 TPT Notes
**Beneficial and Harmful Effects (5.1)**

_5.1.1_
- Accelerometer: a sensor to detect acceleration. Used in cars for airbag release. 
- Computer innovations have beneficial and harmful effects on people, and not everything is anticipated in advance. 

_5.1.2_
- As not all the harmful effects can be predicted, responsible programmers think ahead, as much as they can.  

_TPT 0.1_
1. A beneficial effect of computing is allowing quicker access to the internet for research. At any place, at any time, I have access to information for anything as my fingertips. While studying for tests/homework, this is extremely helpful, as any question that I have can be answered. However, it is extremely easy to get misinformation about a topic. This can provide to creating a closed mindset, with incorrect opinions. 
2. Technology saves an immense amount of time for me, and numerous other scientists. While doing an extremely difficult and tedious problem, it is easy to do it quickly. A computer, such as my graphing calculator is extremely useful in doing this. It is possible for the calculator to not be able to do a problem correctly through overflow, or rounding, makin git harmful was important math problems that millions of dollars depend on. 
3. The most harmful effect of technology for me is getting addicted to social media, and talking to friends online. This ruins my motivation to do homework, studying, or doing productive activities, as I feel that I am glued to a phone/computer screen. On the other hand, it helps one be more informative about current issues, and be more well-informed. 
- My view on dopamine is that it is real. It is extremely rewarding to post something on social media, and reloading the page to see who viewed/liked it. I belive that this ties in with how much you care about how others percieve you. Additionally, for me, using social media is a huge waste of time, as it takes away an immense about of time from your day. This impacts my studying, as I have less time to finish my homework, and sometimes causing me to stay up late. 

**Digital Divide (5.2)**
- Digital divide - refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet based on your income, location, your demographic and more. Raises issues of equity and equality people some have advantages over others. 

_TPT 0.2_
- One empowers themselves in the digitial world by having access to the lastest information in the world, and being updated on currect issues. This creates an informed citizen, that is educated about the world around them. Additionally, having a good and proper education, about how to use the internet. This allows for one to know how to use th web to get information about any resources. 
- One can empower another to financially helping them get out of their situation. We can empower someone else by tellng/updating them about the issues in the world right now. Additonally, we as highschoolers can spread knowledge to others about the divide, and protest for the government to provide more resources. Lastly, we could join nonprofit organizations such as Educationist, and help kids around the world be empowered to knowledge. 
- No, I do not think that red tape or anything else creates a divide in Del Norte. Red tape solely blocks social media, and other non-school related sites, which doesn't block important information.
