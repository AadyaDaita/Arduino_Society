### 5.1-5.6 TPT Notes
**Beneficial and Harmful Effects (5.1)**

_5.1.1_
- Accelerometer: a sensor to detect acceleration. Used in cars for airbag release. 
- Computer innovations have beneficial and harmful effects on people, and not everything is anticipated in advance. 

_5.1.2_
- As not all the harmful effects can be predicted, responsible programmers think ahead, as much as they can.  

_TPT 0.1_
1. A beneficial effect of computing is allowing quicker access to the internet for research. At any place, at any time, I have access to information for anything as my fingertips. While studying for tests/homework, this is extremely helpful, as any question that I have can be answered. However, it is extremely easy to get misinformation about a topic. This can provide to creating a closed mindset, with incorrect opinions. 
2. Technology saves an immense amount of time for me, and numerous other scientists. While doing an extremely difficult and tedious problem, it is easy to do it quickly. A computer, such as my graphing calculator is extremely useful in doing this. It is possible for the calculator to not be able to do a problem correctly through overflow, or rounding, makin git harmful was important math problems that millions of dollars depend on. 
3. The most harmful effect of technology for me is getting addicted to social media, and talking to friends online. This ruins my motivation to do homework, studying, or doing productive activities, as I feel that I am glued to a phone/computer screen. On the other hand, it helps one be more informative about current issues, and be more well-informed. 
- My view on dopamine is that it is real. It is extremely rewarding to post something on social media, and reloading the page to see who viewed/liked it. I belive that this ties in with how much you care about how others percieve you. Additionally, for me, using social media is a huge waste of time, as it takes away an immense about of time from your day. This impacts my studying, as I have less time to finish my homework, and sometimes causing me to stay up late. 

**Digital Divide (5.2)**
- Digital divide - refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet based on your income, location, your demographic and more. Raises issues of equity and equality people some have advantages over others. 

_TPT 0.2_
- One empowers themselves in the digitial world by having access to the lastest information in the world, and being updated on currect issues. This creates an informed citizen, that is educated about the world around them. Additionally, having a good and proper education, about how to use the internet. This allows for one to know how to use th web to get information about any resources. 
- One can empower another to financially helping them get out of their situation. We can empower someone else by tellng/updating them about the issues in the world right now. Additonally, we as highschoolers can spread knowledge to others about the divide, and protest for the government to provide more resources. Lastly, we could join nonprofit organizations such as Educationist, and help kids around the world be empowered to knowledge. 
- No, I do not think that red tape or anything else creates a divide in Del Norte. Red tape solely blocks social media, and other non-school related sites, which doesn't block important information. 



**Computing Bias (5.3)**
- Explicit Data -voluntarily giving data about yourself
- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases written into the algorithm or biases in the data used by the innovation. 
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovation (if they really deserve it) as a way of combating existing human biases.  

_TPT Computer Bias_
- Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
  - No, I do not think that the owner of purposfully made a device that doens't recognize certain individuals. 
- If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
  - This was not on purpose, as sellers want to increase profit, they would want to sell to all types of people. Thus, there is no reason for them to exclude some types of people with facial recognition. 
- How do you think this happened?
  - The creators must have been a team of white people, where they weren't able to test with all types of people. This might have caused unnecessary bias, as proper trials weren't being held. Possibily, a lot about people of other reaces is not known, so this might have reduced representation. 
- Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
  - This is harmful, as it reduced representation of all ethnicities around the world. It creates bias to how other people around the world view certain ethnicities. Thus it is not intended, as it wouldn;t logically make sense for HP to be racist to certain types of people. This would solely reduce the number of people buying their product. However purposeful exclusion of races does exist. 
- Should it be corrected?
  Yes it should be avoided. As said, this creats bias in people, and causes some people of the world to be excluded into results. For example, in medical related resources, when there is bias in devices, it is extremely dangerous, as vital healthcare resources for them can be disregared. 
- What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
  - To improve this, I can be part of testing trials for new devices released, and encourage others to also be part of them as well. This can reduce coomputer bias, as representation increases. 


**Crowdsourcing (5.4)**
- Science has been affected by using distributed and “citizen science” to solve scientific problems. 
- Citizen science is the scientific research conducted in a whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists. Who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices. 
- Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing. 
- Crowdsourcing- the practice of obtaining information or input into a task or project by enlisting the services of a large number of people, either paid or unpaid, typically via the internet.
- Offer new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding. 

_TPT Crowdsourcing_
- CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
  - An idea I had on where Del Norte is able to create a collaboration network, where all students can get inpiriation from each other: have a place where all the past CSP and CSA students can post their projects. This will be beneficial to many beginner coders, or anyone that might need help getting started. Additonally, it can be a place where everyone can fork the project, like in github, to perhaps add to it, creating a collaborating environment and increasing crowdsourcing. 
- What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
  - I have had multiple experiences with Del Norte involved in crowdsourcing. For example, many of the AP Stat students go from class to class, usually all different types of clases to account for all the different type of people, to get information about a topic. This type of data collection includes all the different types of people on the campus, increasing representation. Additonally, students from ASB collect information from students around the campus about different types of topics for DNN news. For our final project, we decided to have a website, where one can use it to get information about Del Norte during an emergency. The website will include all the safe paths on campus during a disaster, attendance for all students and more. Our site would be better with crowdsourcing, as in the case of an emergency, it is vital that all students and teachers from Del Norte know how to use it, and be prepared. Our end goal is to have this website implemented in all schools in our district, as we believe it will be very useful. For this, we need as many people possible to help, contribute, and provide their inputs.


**Legal and Ethical Concerns (5.5)**
- Copy right protects intellectual property unless you allow it. 
- The legal way to use other people’s content is by following the license that they have on their property. 
- Creative Commons -  tells what you can or can’t do with the property. It is a license. 
- Open-source - programs that are free on the internet
- Open Access - online research output free of any and all restrictions on access and free of restrictions on access and free of restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions. 

_5.5 GitHub Actions_
- Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal
   - No Copyright
   - Dedicating work to public
   - Work can be copied, repurposed, and distributed without seeking permission from the creator.
- MIT License
   - Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code.
   - Open Source GPL License
   - Cannot distribute closed source versions.
- I will be using the Open Source MIT license allows users to make modifications to my work, as well as requiring preservation of copyright and license notices.
- For our team repo, we are choosing the Open Source MIT license, we will allow using the code from GitHub to be used freely only to make and distribute closed source versions.

**Safe Computing (5.6)**

_5.6.1_
- Personally Identifiable Information is information about an individual. Hackers can steal these.

_5.6.2_
- Authentication measured protect devices and information from unauthorized access. 
- Authentication measured includes strong passwords and multi-factor authentication 
- Viruses modify the operating system and allow anyone without the correct authorization to enter into your accounts. Malware damages a system and poses to be the original system itself.
- Encryption - the coded message that holds data. It prevents unauthorized malware from accessing data that they are not supposed to. 
- Symmetric - one key used to both encrypt and decrypt data. Sender and receiver both know this key
- Asymmetric - Public key encryption: uses two keys. The public key for encrypting and a private key for decrypting. 
- The sender does not need the receiver’s private key to encrypt a message. 
- The receiver’s private key IS required to decrypt the message. 
- The sender uses the receiver’s public key to encrypt the message. The receiver only had the private key, so they can only decrypt the encrypted message.
- Digital Certificate: certificate authorities issue digital certificates that validate the ownership of the encryption keys used in secure communications and are based on a trust model. 
- Decryption - decoding an encrypted message.  

_5.6.3_
- Phishing: An attempt to trick a user into providing personal information. 
- Keyloggers: records every keystroke made by a user in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords or other confidential information. 
- Rogue Access Point: A wireless network that can give unauthorized access to secure networks. When data is being sent in a network, the hacker could steal in on the way there, before it reaches the secure location. 


_GitHub Actions_
- I have seen Personal Identifiable Information (PII) in the CSP nighthawkcodingsociety website which links to twitter, github, and other information
- I am very safe on the internet and never give my PII to strangers, but I know that if you try and look you can find some of my personal information. But other than my name, birthday, and residence, I don’t think the internet has access to my PII.
- Good passwords are long with a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Bad Passwords have ties to your personal information (family names, dog name, birthday) and dictionary words.
- 2 Factor Authentication is extremely prevalent in our soctiety today. Emais, texts, and software-based authenticators like Google Authenticator are great ways to assist with authentication
- Unlike symmetric encryption, which uses the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information, asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography or public-key encryption, uses mathematically linked public- and private-key pairs to encrypt and decrypt senders’ and recipients’ sensitive data.
- When deploying we initally used HTTP which did not have encryption. But then we used HTTPS which is HTTP with encryption. The difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses.
- Deceptive phishing is the most common type of phishing scam. In this ploy, fraudsters impersonate a legitimate company to steal people’s personal data or login credentials. Those emails use threats and a sense of urgency to scare users into doing what the attackers want.
