I have two technicals:
- The two database tables
  - The first table is about teachers, where it is a list of the teachers, who cna log in
  - Once the teacher is logged in, they can click on a link that will redirect them to their class. There would be a list of the students, an the teacher can update 
    whether the student is absent or not. 
- Voice Search:
  -  The users can navigate to any page on the website, upon their speech.
